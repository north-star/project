        <h3>Welcome to the North Star Project</h3>

        <p>The North Star Project was started out of a DevOps Meet-up
        in Seattle.  The goal is to provide a guide for two groups
        that sometimes have trouble meeting on common ground:  The
        open source community, and the Windows community.  We're
        hoping this can be a tool for both groups to work together and
        provide great products and services.
